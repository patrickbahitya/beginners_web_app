Simple Student registration and examination tracking system(web app).

Programming Language: PHP 


I dedicate this to as I empower the beginners in software development, 
I took the initiative to start my carrier as a software developer first by learning the basics of software 
development and came up with just a simple app for my university allowing an Admin to login using hard coded credentials and perform the CRUD functionalities, 
also a Head of Department(HOD) as a user, that is already registered into the system by the Admin, 
to login using credentials specified by the Admin, to perform simply basic functionalities like enter students’ marks(assessment), view the marks
and similarly another user like the Academic Registrar(AR) to login and register a student,
view registered students and view students’ marks that have been entered by the HOD.

I developed it using php, MySQLi, html, css and bootstrap!

Do you want to start your journey as a software developer? don't rush and panic, just simply start with the basics. when you know the basics, 
it will give you initial energy to want to know more and will act as a stepping stone just as it did for me!
